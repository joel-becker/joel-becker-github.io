              <p>The 4th of the famous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html">36 questions for falling in love</a> is: &ldquo;What would constitute a &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; day for you?&rdquo; On September 10th, 2023, I attempted to live out my answer.</p>
<h2 id="invitation">Invitation</h2>
<p>The message to friends read, with minor edits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please <em>only attend the parts of the day that speak to you, and RSVP if you will join <em>any</em> part of the day</em>! I am expecting some activities to be popular, some activities to involve only me, and for ~no-one to attend everything!</p>
<p>The schedule is:</p>
<ul>
<li>8:30-9:15am, coffee and chocolate tasting wearing onesies, [home address], <em>non-onesie pyjamas allowed, civilian clothes won&rsquo;t be turned away but will be met with disappointed stares</em></li>
<li>10-11:30am, sauna + ice baths, Hackney Wick Sauna Baths, <em>max capacity of 6 so please confirm with me</em></li>
<li>11:35am-12:50pm, lunch, Gotto Trattoria (Hackney Wick)</li>
<li>1-2pm, beautiful walk, Wick Woodland</li>
<li>2:15-3pm, piano hopping, the public piano at stratford international train station, <em>involves public singing</em></li>
<li>3:10-4pm, weightlifting, gymbox westfield stratford, <em>i&rsquo;ll pay for my own + others day passes</em></li>
<li>4:10-4:30pm, smoothies, boost juice bars westfield stratford</li>
<li>5-6pm, trampolining, oxygen O2 arena</li>
<li>7-9pm, dinner party, [home address], <em>max capacity ~20 so check with me</em></li>
<li>9-10pm, wine and reading, [home address], <em>reading on laptop allowed, conversations about reading allowed, but absolutely no work allowed</em></li>
<li>10-11pm, walk in circles around the block calling friends in convenient time zones, area surrounding [home address]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>Of course, constraints prevented me from including a bunch of activities in the day. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Music jam.</li>
<li>Karaoke.</li>
<li>Jacuzzi &lsquo;hot-seat&rsquo; (although we did play non-jacuzzi hot-seat during the dinner party).</li>
<li>Dog cafe with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/its_mr.mushu/">Mushu</a>.</li>
<li>Smores.</li>
<li>Great falafel.</li>
<li>Thinking in a beautiful location with comfortable seating.</li>
<li>Amusement park.</li>
<li>Abba/musical/00&rsquo;s-themed club night.</li>
<li>Themed house party.</li>
<li>Listening to friends share their interests with me (or, more formally, &rsquo;lightening talks&rsquo;).</li>
</ol>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to track my affect during the activities I did do, comparing it with my prior expectations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve booked the private sauna and ice baths a couple of times since the event. £100 for 6 people for 90 minutes is pretty good!</p>
<p>Trampolining, alas, is too far away to regularly bother with.</p>
<p>Piano hopping was much more lame than I expected. (And I love playing and singing for crowds.) I think the crowd having shared enjoyment and context was the missing piece.</p>
<h2 id="planning-challenges">Planning challenges</h2>
<p>The hardest aspect of planning the day was getting the geography right. Ignoring this, arranging ideal activities in preferred order regardless of geography, would have led to costly travel and a much more empty schedule.</p>
<p>This event might have been significantly harder to pull off if I had not been prepared to pay for the entire thing myself. In the end, I more or less did pay for everything, but note that what matters is only the worst-case <em>commitment</em> to paying. Money makes coordinating people to be in the same place at the same time much easier &ndash; once coordinated, people are happier to pay! I could have been firmer about tracking expense shares and following up on this, without making the event noticeably worse.</p>
