<h1 id="what-is-the-breakdown-between-growth-full-time-and-part-time">What is the breakdown between growth full-time and part-time?</h1>
<p>The question: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/view/articles/2017-10-04/too-many-people-dream-of-a-charmed-life-in-academia">Noah Smith</a> wrote up a point about how part-time instructors have exploded in the U.S. I want to know if this is new institutions using part-time, or is it old institutions switching?</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>I'm using the 1987, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2015 Fall Staff Survey from IPEDS to look at it. It's a pain to harmonize but I think I roughly have it. First, I spot checked the result from Noah to my data. I'm focusing on just full-time faculty vs part-time. I'm ignoring the tenure-track vs not. I don't think that plays a big role in the argument, although being full-time non-tenure is also not the dream for a lot of Ph.D.s.</p>
<p>The other thing I'm ignoring is Graduate Students. Mainly for speed, this is very gettable from the data. The number I'd like to match is 33/(33+14+34) = 40% around 1995, and 40 / (29+17+ 40) = 46% in 2015. If anything, I have a slightly higher number here. My 1987 data is weird though, and looks like something is off. Otherwise, you see a trend that is very similar to what Noah was pointing to.</p>

<p>Ok, so what share of this from new institutions vs changes? I assumed that the institution ID was constant over time to construct a panel. Then, I can look at the changes over time vs new schools. Of course, as I do this, I discover the ids for the 1987 and 1991 data are not working, so I drop those two years. This still leaves us an interesting 20 years, but not quite as cool.</p>

<p>What I do is take the changes in each period of the raw numbers, and ask how much of the change is from a change within an institution, and how much is from new institutions. I first plot the overall number of each type. Then, I plot the share from within institution vs overall. I</p>

<p>Of that change, existing institutions make up about 75% of the growth over the past 20 years, according to my calculations.</p>
