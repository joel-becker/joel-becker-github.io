There is a near-consensus that diet is more important than exercise, at least for aesthetics. 

I think this idea suffers from a similar problem as that suffered by 'calories in calories out': although it might be true in some idealized sense, "[calories out are endogenous to what is eaten](https://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/2019/10/8/the-carbohydrate-insulin-model-wars)". 

Here, diet-in-reality is largely determined by 'the kind of person you believe yourself to be.' **Exercising more makes it easier to see yourself as the kind of person who takes diet seriously, and therefore improves diet. The reverse doesn't feel true.**
