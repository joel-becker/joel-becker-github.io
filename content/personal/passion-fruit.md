This list is a work-in-progress. If you have any suggestions for passion fruit products for me to try, send me a [message](https://joel-becker.com/#contact)!

1. **Passion Fruit - agua de maracuya**
   1. This "Passion Fruit" is a smoothie place in La Condesa (CDMX) that sells, among other treats, passion fruit juice by the bucket. My favorite passion fruit product of all time! I love that it isn't too sweetened, and that the seeds have separated from the juice. 
   2. The only problem is the large blocks of ice that they put in the buckets. Fish it out, or consume your litre as fast as you can.
   3. [Link to the UberEats page here](https://www.ubereats.com/mx/store/passion-fruit/HAiBwZcVTL-0gIKNy-XhKQ/05405358-1cdb-4054-83d3-51a59a68a037/0379a62a-1156-4ddb-a09a-7e1dc45d5dfb/e1bce849-9ffe-482d-88f3-f61f7c4db9ef).
2. **little moons - Passion Fruit and Mango Mochi**
   1. A nice supermarket product, but the passion fruit flavor could be stronger.

3. **Dishoom - Passionfruit Sharbat**
   1. [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/) is the best Indian restaurant in the UK. Their passionfruit sharbat varies in quality by bartending staff, but when it's good, it's great.
4. **Gelateria Santa Trinita - Passion fruit Gelato**
   1. I stumbled across [this place](http://www.gelateriasantatrinita.it/en/index.php) in Florence -- it seemed quite popular, so I imagine it might be on tourist guides.
   2. They serve the best passion fruit-flavored ice cream.
