My friend Arden and I were curious about hosting a sensory deprivation (or heightening) event. We began brainstorming:

> blindfolded hide-and-seek	but with a bell, or squeaky chickens (better if they can be quiet). in multiple bedrooms? with multiple seekers?
> mix ingredients together in one team, have second team blind taste it	play with general idea of one team makes a thing, other has to identify. maybe do it telephone style?
> sensory deprivation relay: diff team members have diff senses deprived	
> muffled speed-dating	
> karaoke but only the singer is muffled (maybe humiliation shared between 2 people, hard to stay in sync)	
> blindfolded dancing	
> blind jenga	
> silent telephone of one kind of another	
> event brainstorming cool event ideas	

Eventually, we settled on running a blindfolded dinner, giant jenga, and hide-and-seek event: a "masked mixer."

This post is part-description of a wonderful evening, part-guide for anyone who wants to run a similar event.

## The invite

> elevate your senses by taking one of them away!
> 
> agenda:
> - blindfolded dinner party.
> - split into ~3 teams.
> - blindfolded jenga.
> - blindfolded hide-and-seek. with bells attached!
> - tally up scores.
> - (if time left over) blindfolded dancing. celebrate the winners!

## Pre-reqs

- Food which (1) isn't very messy and (2) has interesting texture. We went for Japanese.
- Lots of cheap [blindfolds](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07C266LNK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), bells, and means of attaching bells to wrists. We used rubber bands and sewing thread.
- Giant jenga sets, around 1 per 4 attendees.

## Dinner

Attendees enter and are immediately blindfolded. Bells are attached to their wrists. They are led to the main space and seated. Ask if anyone is fussy about food.

The hosts, not masked, quickly take turns around attendees, giving them an unnamed food item to eat. This part isn't a game -- attendees are naturally curious about what they're eating, but they don't get points for guessing or whatever.

## Giant jenga

Split the group into teams of 4ish, each of which is given a giant jenga set. Team members will take turns pulling out blocks following announcements from the host; the team that first causes the tower to fall loses.

## Hide-and-seek

The same teams are split into hiders and seekers. To prevent injury, both groups are strongly instructed to go on their bums whenever approaching or traveling via stairs. Hiders are given 5 minutes to hide, then seekers are given 5 minutes to find them, then the roles switch. The winning team is whichever has found the most hiders.

## Dancing

Don't end with dancing! Being blindfolded for 2-3 hours is surprisingly tiring. The group decided to unwind by putting faces to names -- i.e. remove blindfolds and hang out. A great choice.
