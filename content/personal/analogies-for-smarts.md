## Seeing through clouds

In 200X, Masha Gessen wrote a [series of articles for Slate]() about X. [CAME TO THE ECONOMIST DAVID]

I've had a number of similar interactions with David. He seems to have this (from my perspective) superhuman ability to cut through the crap, to highlight the pivotal issue in some decision directly. 

In Gessen's article, the pivotal issue is roughly "do I prefer living much more of my life as an older person, or have a doubled mortality rate?" This sounds like an obvious way of thinking about the problem once I see it presented that way, but it definitely wasn't obvious to me when I was first staring at the words "Oophorectomy and Mastectomy."

When I try 

## Precision and recall

'Precision' is X, 'recall' is Y.

An in-the-know friend of mine thinks that unusually paranoid people can make for strong hires at some hedge funds. The thought is that, in certain roles, the cost of not spotting real patterns (that other people think are false) is much larger than the cost of spotting false patterns (that other people agree are false). In other environments, a person who thinks that they have connected dots that are in fact unrelated might reasonably be described as 'paranoid.'

On the other hand, one can imagine people for whom the pattern-spotting dial is turned down across the board. These 'skeptics' are less prone to the mistake of seeing patterns in randomness, but they're also less quick to find patterns that are really there.

Neither the paranoid nor the skeptical person are necessarily smarter than me. In the precision-recall framework, they're worse at one aspect of thinking but better at another.

Still, some people -- call them '[international math] olympians' -- come across to me as noticeably stronger on both dimensions.

One way I often experience this gap is that smarter people are more willing to step back and ask questions that I might have expected to sound dumb to 

## Bonus analogy

Here's an analogy that might underlie both of the previous analogies: tree search depth.

Why is it that David can zoom in on pivotal considerations long before I can, or that the Olympian avoids my mistakes? Perhaps they can traverse reasoning trees of greater depth than I can in a given time frame.

It's not that I _can't_ reproduce David's thoughts or the Olympian's accuracy. It's that I require much more time to do it. By the time I have got to the final reasoning leaf and need to make a best guess, others have already explored a greater space and found a better path.

> like: what’s the goal here, or does this word mean the thing we think it means, or repeatedly asking why do you think that. maybe this is just “the bits that k can emulate are the bits i am smart enough to generate.” i do think there’s some of that. there are probably a larger number of questions i think are dumb, only some of which are false negatives, and smarter people have better precision/recall. but then i have the identical feeling reversed with people who are might think of me as smarter than them. on reflection there’s no contradiction. maybe conversational intelligence is tightly related to this precision/recall thing. more evidence: there are some people that i speak to who are smarter than me in legible ways (ie killing it at MIT) but i feel unusually smart in conversation with them (vs neel/others/ftx). this is almost always because of the precision/recall thing conditional on raw g.
