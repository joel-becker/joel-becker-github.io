When you purchase an hour of time, it is not immediately obvious how much value you get, because (1) different hours have different value, and (2) it is not always clear _which_ hour you are purchasing.

## Different hours have different value

Ways in which an hour can be more valuable to you include:

1. Time of day: morning, evening.
2. Social context: with friends, with family, with strangers, alone.
3. Location: at home, at work, at an art studio, on a beach, in a hospital.
4. Activity: working, reading, Netflix, eating, sleeping, exercising, meditating.

There are probably hours characterized by some combination of the above that are worth more to you (holiday with friends), and others that are worth less (Netflix in the evening). 

## Which hour are you purchasing

Imagine that you are on holiday, wanting to see a major historical site. There is a 1-hour task in your way that you could either complete yourself or pay somebody $X to do for you.

If you pay the $X, which hour are you purchasing?

The obvious answer is that you are purchasing 1-hour of visiting the major historical site. But, I claim, this answer is naive.

I think that this answer is naive. Instead, I claim, you are purchasing 1 of at least 3 types of hour:

1. A *bonus* hour later in the day, which you would have spent visiting the historical site but for the fact that you left earlier as a result of arriving earlier.
2. An *extension* hour visiting the historical site, in case you visit for $n+1$ hours when you otherwise would have visited for $n$ hours.
3. A *reclaimed* hour earlier in the day, in case you do something else with the purchased hour, then arrive at the historical site at a similar time to the time you would have arrived at without purchasing the hour.

## How valuable is the hour

The question of whether you have over- or under-valued the purchased hour is underspecified. If you bought a displaced hour, then the value of the hour depended on activities later in the day. If you bought the marginal hour, then the value of the hour depended on how much you value additional (not typical/average) time at the historical site. And if you bought the replacement hour then, although in some sense you _have_ purchased the same hour, the value depended on the alternative activities (etc.) that would characterize that hour.
