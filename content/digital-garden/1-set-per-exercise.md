I prefer for my  weightlifting workouts to involve just 1 set per exercise.

There isn't exactly conventional wisdom on this question, but it's extremely common to stick with 3 or so sets per exercise. Defenders of the status quo, when pressed, say something like "3 sets helps you measure progression," which is obviously nonsense (you could still maintain a consistent ordered list of exercises  with 1 set per exercise).

What are the trade-offs? 

In favor of 1 set per exercise:

1. More variety/fun -- the most important foundation of a consistent workout routine.
2. Less risk of imbalances and injuries from overuse.
3. Less anxiety about people taking up particular machines (to the extent that 1 set per exercise helps you abandon the consistent ordered list).

And against:

1. More time spent switching between exercises? (Not really, if you use adequate rest times.)
2. Fewer compound movements? (Not really, there are more than enough variations on compound movements per muscle group to get enough compound sets in.)
3. Nothing else?
