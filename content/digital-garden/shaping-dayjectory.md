Suppose you agree with me that [discussion of the "value of time" is ridden with conceptual confusion](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/mistakes-valuing-time/).

- you seek a better way
- see conceptual confusion 1
- notice that even if you can state how much better an hour of your time will be with friends vs alone, at cafe vs office, etc., you don't know _which hour_ this is occurring during
- toby has framework for this!

Toby Ord [presents](http://amirrorclear.net/files/shaping-humanity's-longterm-trajectory.pdf) a simple mathematical framework for understanding how reducing existential risk compares with other ways of influencing the longterm future.

I have been thinking through ideas with similar stakes myself. Recently, I got frustrated with [conceptual confusions in the value of time](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/mistakes-valuing-time/), and spent some time trying to deconfuse myself.

But a new problem keeps popping up: _which hour_ are we talking about the value of?

To start to see why this is a problem, consider the first mistake I outlined:

> The value of a purchased hour depends on more than just wage level.

On the standard model, to simplify somewhat, you begin facing a decision of whether to spend time completing some task yourself, or to pay someone of something to do it for you at a cost of $X. All hours are worth the same amount to you, and work hours are perfectly flexible, so you reason that your implicit decision is whether to purchase an hour of leisure or work -- which each have identical value $Y to you, since you've already solved [the implicit labor supply problem](LINK) -- at $X. If $Y > $X, it's time to pay up.

Now suppose you agree with me that it's important to consider factors like time of day, location, and the activity you will be doing with this counterfactual hour. This might lead you to think that paying $X is definitely worth it on the morning of a holiday when you can see a major historical site (worth $A > $Y), but not on a weekday evening when you're otherwise going to watch Netflix (worth $B < $Y).

But this is not the end of the story. Step back and reconsider: which hour are you purchasing? In the holiday example, you might think that you are purchasing the chance to see the historical site. But, more likely, you are shifting your visit to the holiday site 1 hour earlier, thus purchasing an evening hour. Or perhaps you are extending your historical site trip by 1 hour, hence purchasing merely the 3rd or 4th rather than 1st hour of the visit.

What a mess!

But it gets worse. 

Consider the weekday evening example again. Let's say that if you purchased the hour, you would spend that hour working on some task.

Completing this task earlier means that you begin your second task earlier. If you model your work life as a conveyor belt of tasks that you are asked to complete, then you might think that, in some sense, the counterfactual task that you are paying (and being paid) to do is in fact the _final_ task on the conveyor belt, one that you just about wouldn't have gotten around to if you didn't purchase the hour. To the degree that this task is more interesting or better paid, you might think that the value of the hour is higher.

Something similar might be said if your model is that completing the task now causes the conveyor belt to speed up, or causes you to be reassigned to a higher-value conveyor belt, rather than shifting over everything on the conveyor belt as above.

Perhaps you think that the conveyor belt analogy doesn't work. Energy is the limiting factor, in such a way that completing the task in the evening will necessitate leisure at some other time.

But in this case too, the standard model doesn't make sense: the trajectory of hours has changed.

Given purchased hour might change trajectory of value for just that hour, or speed up all hours, or shift all hours, or maybe add some constant or proportional amount of value to many hours.
