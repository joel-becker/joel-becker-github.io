I don't have a good articulation of my current aesthetic tastes. (Because I am insufficiently articulate and/or they are incoherent.) But here are some pointers.

(I've tried to make this close-ish-to-orthogonal to [my enjoyment](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/favorite-things/) of or respect for these things, with only partial success. A bunch of the pointers below share the vibe of "maximization good, moderation bad" -- I especially want to emphasize this as a case where my aesthetics come apart from what I think is good on reflection.)

Good:

1. Purple.
2. Truth-seeking, the activity.
3. [Sports as religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbWvR4en78w).
4. Musical theatre, Kendrick, JME, 00's bangers, Jacob Collier, melody-free techno.
5. [The future belongs to the obsessed](https://youtu.be/m3kJo5kEzTQ?si=6Lz_wBLsbKhUVV2Y&t=1663).
6. Inter-generational living.
7. Harshly subverting gendered expectations.
8. Exaggeration for effect, gesticulation, moving around whilst in conversation, [Camille Paglia's speaking style](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/camille-paglia/).
9. Strong commitment to principles; Austin Chen's commitment to total transparency.
10. Betting on beliefs.
11. Simone Weil, [Corey Booker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7fFOJVnpeA).
12. The Lincoln Memorial.
13. Large plants, hanging plants.
14. Water flowing over rocks.
15. The uniquely rationalist communication style that kind of sounds like a philosophy seminar translated into "folksy," [exemplified by Buck Shlegeris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTlrPeikoyw).
16. John Maynard Keynes.
17. Massage; fancy cocktails; coffee-/wine-tasting.
18. [Being strategic](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/strategic/); paying close attention to where the thing you're optimizing for deviates from your goalsn.
19. [Fractal planning](https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1599609660541382657).
20. 90% clothes that look generically good on pinterest, 10% Jacob Collier/[Agnes Callard](https://x.com/AgnesCallard/status/1276269431262531587).
21. ~20% body fat.
22. [Gil Carvalho's nutrition takes](https://podcast.clearerthinking.org/episode/212/gil-carvalho-what-we-know-and-don-t-know-about-nutrition/).
23. [Radical markets](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36515770-radical-markets), [Slouching Towards Utopia](https://www.amazon.com/Economic-History-Twentieth-Century/dp/0465019595).
24. Harvey Milk; confident subcultures that aren't insular.
25. Scrubs.
26. Poetry.

Bad:

1. Brown.
2. Truth seeking, the phrase.

7. Not teaching the massacre of Germans after WWII.
8. Holiday planning.
9. Caring too much about Californian housing policy.
10. Not taking yourself too seriously.
