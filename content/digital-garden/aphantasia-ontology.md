I have [aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia).

People usually respond to this fact with "how do you X" questions, which I feel helpless to answer, because there isn't a well-developed language for these things.

1. *How do I navigate in familiar spaces?* I... erm... "feel" it...? I can just sort of sense the spatial distance between things, without these things having visual representations. It's a bit like if you were awake, closed your eyes and attempted to navigate a familiar space -- my guess is that people don't imagine the table to be avoided 2 feet ahead of them, rather they have some spatial sense that doesn't run through visual imagery.
2. *How do I dream?* I mostly don't. When I do, obviously, there is no visual content, nor sound nor speech. It feels like a stream of thoughts and concepts. Any movement through space feels like the above "feeling" of navigating a familiar space.
3. *How do I mentally rehearse future events, such as a presentation?* Again, I more or less don't. If it's important enough, I will write down thoughts, record myself, or practice with a friend. The vast majority of the time, I wing it.
4. *How do I engage with new narratives or descriptions?* I just kind of sit with it and hope I absorb the relevant details. Friends have commented that when they describe new ideas, I have this odd habit of mouthing back the words they are saying immediately after they say them. I suspect that this might be compensatory behavior.

You can see why describing navigation, dreams, mental arithmetic, recalling physical appearances and so on using the word "feel" is inadequate. (Previously I would have used "imagine," until learning that most people were using this in a totally crazy way.)

So, here's a first attempt at an ontology of aphantasia.

1. **Spatial proprioception:** the ability to sense and manipulate mental representations of space and objects using non-visual cues.
2. **Conceptual stream:** an experienced stream of thoughts, ideas, and narratives as a continuous flow, without visual or auditory annotation.
3. **Embodied cognition:** utilizing bodily sensations and physical experiences to process and understand information.
4. **Osmotic perception or recall:** the process of memories and details absorbing or surfacing, effortlessly and imperfectly, without explicit mental rehearsal.
