An example of how one might arrange one of [my mashups](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/mashups/).

Some notes on this one:

1. The arrangement is very simple and rigid. Ideally you want to get some [confident singers singing lyrics to different songs](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/intuitions-singalongs/) over one another, flowing in and out of songs as feels right. But the simpler way to do this -- wordless melody, as here -- works nicely, especially with a less familiar crowd.
2. The worldess melody here is from Hamilton's "[My Shot](https://youtu.be/r1izVfVpBwE?si=4KoI_tKJgi2WdWb4&t=349)."
3. Another feature that makes this easier to follow: matching rapped lyrics with sung melodies.
4. You can mix this Havana, Levitating, or Hotel California. (If adding Hotel California, changing around the root on the Bm and D especially can be helpful; the original goes roughly Bm, F#, A, E; G, D, Em, F#.)

| **Chords** | **Part 1** | **Part 2** |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Bm, F#     | **I'ma get a scholarship to King's College; I probably shouldn't brag, but dang, I amaze and astonish** | |
| D, Em, F#  | The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish; I gotta holler just to be heard, with every word, I drop knowledge | |
| Bm, F#     | I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal; tryna reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable | |
| D, Em, F#  | Only nineteen but my mind is older; these New York City streets get colder, I shoulder | |
|            |            | |
| Bm, F#     | Every burden, every disadvantage, I have learned to manage; I don't have a gun to brandish, I walk these streets famished | |
| D, Em, F#  | The plan is to fan this spark into a flame; but damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out my name | |
| Bm, F#     | I am the A-L-E-X-A-N-D; E-R we are meant to be | |
| D, Em, F#  | A colony that runs independently; meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly | |
|            |            | |
| Bm, F#     | Essentially, they tax us relentlessly; then King George turns around, runs a spendin' spree | |
| D, Em, F#  | He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free; so there will be a revolution in this century | |
| Bm, F#     | Enter me (he says in parentheses); don't be shocked when your history book mentions me | |
| D, Em, F#  | I will lay down my life if it sets us free; eventually, you'll see my ascendancy | |
|            |            | |

| D, Em, F#  | Whoooaaa, whoooaaa | Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar? |
| Bm, F#     | Whoa, whoa, whoooaaa | The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father, got a lot farther by working a lot harder |
| D, Em, F#  | Whoooaaa, whoooaaa | By being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter, by fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter |
|            |            | |

| D, Em, F#  | Whoooaaa, whoooaaa | Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of, the brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter |
| Bm, F#     | Whoa, whoa, whoooaaa | Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned, our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain |
| D, Em, F#  | Whoooaaa, whoooaaa | Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain, and he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain |
|            |            | |
