Last week, I was feeling low after a professional set-back. I called up my friend Nuno.

*"Do you want me to listen to your ramblings, or do you want to solve the problem?"*

30 minutes later, we turned to solving the problem. 

*"You must stop self-pitying."*

After the call, I gave myself evidence that I was the kind of person who was on the path to achieving my goals. I started wearing nice clothes, made bold professional asks, and tried to be lively at social events. And so it was. I had memed myself into not self-pitying.

I've done more profound versions of this before. Examples include:

1. Enjoying soccer. When I was a kid I thought that sports were dumb. Then, aged ~12, I decided that I wanted more guy friends, surveyed the things that guys did, and settled on soccer. I ended this period with a 300,000-strong audience for my soccer takes, and a co-owned statistics consultancy advising professional teams.
2. [Working hard](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bCLoXDbnYSQab8T5t/how-have-you-become-more-hard-working?commentId=SeZXXBWtB43AKsSwJ).
3. Loving America. I grew up thinking that the US seemed almost barbaric, moved there, changed my mind, made loving the US a significant part of my personality. I think this gave me the [force-of-will required for self-sponsoring the O-1](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/cost-of-o1/).
4. Being athletic. After I [fell off the exercise train in 2022-23](https://joel-becker.shinyapps.io/life-dashboard/), I [wrote about weightlifting](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/exercise-vs-diet/), in order to give myself evidence that I was the kind of person who exercised. I've since hit some all-time personal bests.

A remaining curiosity: what are the limits here?
