[Scope-sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect) is one of my favorite ideas.

In this post, I will apply the concept to personal finance. *The idea to do this is entirely due to my friend [Arden](https://www.ardenkoehler.com/). I'm just writing it down.*

I'll survey some options, then discuss what I take from them.

## Options

### Transportation

### Food

### Consumer goods

### Finance

### Work

[ANALYSIS]

best allocation for me

best allocation as function of cost of time

[TAKEAWAYS]

[NOTES]

1. wait, work seems like odd one out. that's a way to spend time, not way to spend money. i guess same for finance. if i did scope-sensitive time allocation post this could also include time with family etc.! altho this is scary kettle of fish, how to think about it? you want to allocate time across things, how to maximize $ or happiness?
2. therefore, this should only be money trades.
3. but wait, lots of these things _are_ time-money trades! like buying more expensive option instead of spending more time looking through stuff. so what exactly is the distinction? maybe ask arden.
   1. ok zoom out again. which things in life are a big deal vs not? in altruism, this is respect to number of human-equivalent lives saved or something. here, it's... how happy you are? time saved? money made? then trade off these metrics later?
   2. and... this post is about time saved only? a diff one about money made? diff one about fulfilment? it could be about all of them at same time -- bundle of time/money/fulfilment -- but this seems complicated and then confuses the different posts. also idk these aren't really separate things.
   3. ask arden!!
4. i should hire econ micro theory RA to work on model of time allocation! help me think clearly about it, could publish something cool.
