Maybe there are many axes of internal experience with significant variation; [aphantasia/vividness of visual imagery is merely easiest to name](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/aphantasia-ontology/).

Some candidates:

1. Vividness of imagination for senses other than sight -- smell, taste, touch.
2. Stability/control of imagination.
3. Seeing connections/structure vs. more descriptive picture -- paranoia/apophenia, literal-mindedness.
4. Strength of associations -- [bouba/kiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect), synesthesia.
5. Internal monologue vs... mentalese?
6. Intensity of sensory experience.
