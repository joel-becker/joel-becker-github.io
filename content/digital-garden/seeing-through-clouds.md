> von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.

## Seeing through clouds

Masha Gessen once wrote a series of articles for Slate grappling with her BRCA mutation. In the [third article](https://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/features/2004/a_medical_quest/in_which_it_is_mathematically_proven_that_the_doctors_were_right_after_all.html), she meets with my old boss David Laibson, hoping that he might be able to help think through the problem of whether to get an Oophorectomy, a Mastectomy, both, or neither. David quickly formulates the problem and finds the pivotal consideration: 'do I prefer living much more of my life as an older person, or have a doubled mortality rate?'.

I've had a number of lower-stakes but structurally similar interactions with David. He seems to have this (from my perspective) superhuman ability to cut through muddled thinking, to shine a spotlight on the conceptually simple pivotal issue in some decision that, from my perspective, was deeply confusing.

## Seeing clouds

What makes David so much smarter than me, at least in the "horse-power for everyday life" sense? 

It doesn't feel like he is creating insights that I cannot fathom. Far from it. 

Instead, the analogy that I am drawn to is that of "seeing through clouds." When I look at the problem, I see clouds. Maybe I can make out outlines. In some instances I could wait for the weather to improve. But, unless I'm having a lucky day, my seeing will be slower, effortful, unreliable. David, meanwhile, sees clear sky.

Part of why I like this analogy is because it works not only between-people, but within-me. In particular, relative to my hungover or extremely tired self, my well-rested self sees through clouds.
