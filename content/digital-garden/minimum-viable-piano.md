1. Use only root notes, 1 octave apart, in the left hand.
	1. More feels too busy.
2. Transition between chords using reasonable notes (again separated by an octave) in the left hand.
	1. Any note in the triad of the chord being transitioned to.
	2. Any note that is (a) inside the shortest distance between the root note being transitioned from and root note being transitioned to and (b) in the key of the song. (But ideally closer to the root note being transitioned to.)
3. When relevant, for emphasis, move left-hand downwards in semi-tones and tones only.
	1. Piano Man ([C, B, A, G, F, E, D, G](https://youtu.be/fJ3zHBT_rVQ?si=3FaMgbsmL9JtRu3x&t=12)), Wake Me Up When September Ends ([G, F#, E, D, C, C](https://youtu.be/zM1n_aEF9PA?si=nR7muYUUflXcdADW&t=13)), I Don't Know How to Love Him ([G, F#, E, D](https://youtu.be/5_zgKSFtVlg?si=h4qtIrxqunepuIUy&t=50)), and Your Song ([B, A, G#, G](https://youtu.be/6MdE_fGjXis?si=X5uEfKEBRIn-IyYv&t=195)) are all strong examples.
	2. Often this is a good reason to disobey rule 1.
4. Add a manageable amount of flavor to the right hand.
	1. Try to use chords that are more open, less closed. In many situations, playing e.g. E-G-E over C is a more pleasant C major than C-E-G triad (or inversion) over C.
	2. Quickly intersperse inverted triads with their sus2/sus4 and 6th/9th variations.
5. Find "strumming patterns" between the left and right hands that work in a variety of situations. When in doubt, stick with only playing both hands on the first beat of a given chord.

Once you have Minimum Viable Piano down:

1. You know the rhythmic patterns that make sense; copy this over to guitar/ukulele/mandelin, learn to bar chords, include the sus2/sus4 and 6th/9th positions much as you would in piano.
2. During singalongs, mentally note which songs have approximately similar chord progressions. [Put these together as mash-ups](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/mashups/).
3. [Find some other guitarists, bring some enthusiastic friends, practice making people feel included](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/intuitions-singalongs/).
