      <title>Fitness advice for someone exactly like me</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m occasionally asked for fitness advice. (Credentials at the end.) Here it is, with one small caveat: for best results, you should be exactly like me. I am not promising methods that fit most people&amp;rsquo;s goals! My advice might be helpful to the extent that you:
Care about appearances at least as much as other fitness goals (health, flexibility, strength, etc.). Are happy to do non-weightlifting sports no more than twice per week.</description>

      <title>My favorite passion fruit products</title>

      <description>This list is a work-in-progress. In descending order of preference:
Passion Fruit - agua de maracuya This &amp;ldquo;Passion Fruit&amp;rdquo; is a smoothie place in La Condesa (CDMX) that sells, among other treats, passion fruit juice by the bucket. My favorite passion fruit product of all time! I love that it isn&amp;rsquo;t too sweetened, and that the seeds have separated from the juice. The only problem is the large blocks of ice that they put in the buckets.</description>

      <description>One day, once I have long-term security in where I live, I want to open a series of cafes.
Sauna and ice baths cafe. Dog cafe. Plant shop cafe. Austrian delicatessen-cafe. Napolitan cafe. </description>

      <description>Following many others, here are some things I recommend buying because they give me considerably more value than I paid for them.
US immigration lawyers
Dungarees
Spare laptop batteries
Many replacement chargers
Large pill box
Cerave skincare products
Fulfil bars
Only the ~200 calorie ones; the ~150 calorie ones are crap imitations.
Yogurt with great macros
Trampolining
Sauna and ice baths</description>
