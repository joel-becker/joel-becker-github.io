      <description>von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.
Edward Teller
Seeing through clouds Masha Gessen once wrote a series of articles for Slate grappling with her BRCA mutation. In the third article, she meets with my old boss David Laibson, hoping that he might be able to help think through the problem of whether to get an Oophorectomy, a Mastectomy, both, or neither.</description>

      <description>Friend that complements existing hobbies. Karaoke-loving weightlifter. Soccer player who is into intense thinking retreats. Acoustic- or bass-guitar-playing event planner. Friend that expands my horizons. Poetry-writing mechanical engineer. Yoga-practicing interior designer. History-obsessed cook. Fancy-bar-tending cheese-taster. Friend that has extreme and almost-aspirational character traits. Earnestness and virtuosity, pointed in a very different direction to that which I am used to. Gregariousness, intentionally directed. Extremely into self-improvement, or extremely anti-self-improvement Unabashed boldness.</description>

      <title>The cost of an O-1 visa</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/personal/cost-of-o1/</link>

      <description>Not legal advice.
I estimate that the O-1 visa process:
Cost me around $37k in resources and time working towards the visa (&amp;ldquo;accounting terms&amp;rdquo;), or $77k in resources, time working towards the visa, and time not working as a result of waiting for the visa (&amp;ldquo;economic terms&amp;rdquo;). Would have taken ~8 months excluding unrelated delays. Links to code for these estimates here and here.
The main cost estimate &amp;ndash; accounting cost &amp;ndash; consists of my time (~$12k), my PA&amp;rsquo;s time (~$7k), lawyer fees ($11k), administrative costs ($3k), and necessary organization expenses (~$4k).</description>

      <description>My friend Arden and I were curious about hosting a sensory deprivation (or heightening) event. We began brainstorming:
blindfolded hide-and-seek; but with a bell, or squeaky chickens (better if they can be quiet). in multiple bedrooms? with multiple seekers? mix ingredients together in one team, have second team blind taste it	play with general idea of one team makes a thing, other has to identify. maybe do it telephone style? sensory deprivation relay: diff team members have diff senses deprived muffled speed-dating karaoke but only the singer is muffled (maybe humiliation shared between 2 people, hard to stay in sync) blindfolded dancing blind jenga silent telephone of one kind of another event brainstorming cool event ideas Eventually, we settled on running a blindfolded dinner, giant jenga, and hide-and-seek event: a &amp;ldquo;masked mixer.</description>

      <title>Diet is endogenous to exercise</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/personal/exercise-vs-diet/</link>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/personal/exercise-vs-diet/</guid>
      <description>There is a near-consensus that diet is more important than exercise, at least for aesthetics.
I think this idea suffers from a similar problem as that suffered by &amp;lsquo;calories in calories out&amp;rsquo;: although it might be true in some idealized sense, &amp;ldquo;calories out are endogenous to what is eaten&amp;rdquo;.
Here, diet-in-reality is largely determined by &amp;rsquo;the kind of person you believe yourself to be.&amp;rsquo; Exercising more makes it easier to see yourself as the kind of person who takes diet seriously, and therefore improves diet.</description>

      <description>The 4th of the famous 36 questions for falling in love is: &amp;ldquo;What would constitute a &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo; day for you?&amp;rdquo; On September 10th, 2023, I attempted to live out my answer.
Invitation The message to friends read, with minor edits:
Please only attend the parts of the day that speak to you, and RSVP if you will join any part of the day! I am expecting some activities to be popular, some activities to involve only me, and for ~no-one to attend everything!</description>

      <title>Optimal workout split</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve gotten past novitiate weightlifting aches, enduring 4+ sessions weekly. How should you now split exercises across days?
My answer is: use the posterior-anterior split. One day for the muscles used in a deadlift (back, hamstrings, glutes) plus biceps, one day for more-or-less everything else (chest, front- and side-delts, triceps, quads, hip flexors).
Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
The goal We want to train muscle groups as intensively as possible, as frequently as possible, whilst not training the same muscle group within fewer than 48 hours.</description>

      <title>My favorite passion fruit products</title>

      <description>This list is a work-in-progress. In descending order of preference:
Passion Fruit - agua de maracuya This &amp;ldquo;Passion Fruit&amp;rdquo; is a smoothie place in La Condesa (CDMX) that sells, among other treats, passion fruit juice by the bucket. My favorite passion fruit product of all time! I love that it isn&amp;rsquo;t too sweetened, and that the seeds have separated from the juice. The only problem is the large blocks of ice that they put in the buckets.</description>

      <description>Epistemic status: not sure how reliable my intuition is, but I do have more experience with these programs than most.
TL;DR Making sure &amp;gt;30 participants have regular opportunities to spontaneously gather, active programming, basic food and medical amenities, and common knowledge about visit dates hugely increases the benefit of residential fellowship programs.
For transparency, I should note a stronger, less confident belief of mine that I will not defend here. My instinct is that all of the above factors are not merely beneficial but necessary in order for these programs to be worth their cost (assuming that their goals are indeed as I describe below).</description>
