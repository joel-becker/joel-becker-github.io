      <title>An ontology of aphantasia</title>

      <description>I have aphantasia.
People usually respond to this fact with &amp;ldquo;how do you X&amp;rdquo; questions, which I feel helpless to answer, because there isn&amp;rsquo;t a well-developed language for these things.
How do I navigate in familiar spaces? I&amp;hellip; erm&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; it&amp;hellip;? I can just sort of sense the spatial distance between things, without these things having visual representations. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like if you were awake, closed your eyes and attempted to navigate a familiar space &amp;ndash; my guess is that people don&amp;rsquo;t imagine the table to be avoided 2 feet ahead of them, rather they have some spatial sense that doesn&amp;rsquo;t run through visual imagery.</description>

      <description>Last week, I was feeling early depression symptoms after a professional set-back. I called up my friend Nuno.
&amp;ldquo;Do you want me to listen to your ramblings, or do you want to solve the problem?&amp;rdquo;
30 minutes later, we turned to solving the problem. &amp;ldquo;You must stop self-pitying.&amp;rdquo;
After the call, I gave myself evidence that I was the kind of person who was on the path to achieving my goals.</description>

      <title>Different hours have different value</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/hours-have-different-value/</link>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/hours-have-different-value/</guid>
      <description>When you purchase an hour of time, it is not immediately obvious how much value you get, because (1) different hours have different value, and (2) it is not always clear which hour you are purchasing.
Different hours have different value Ways in which an hour can be more valuable to you include:
Time of day: morning, evening. Social context: with friends, with family, with strangers, alone. Location: at home, at work, at an art studio, on a beach, in a hospital.</description>

      <title>Ignoring the future when valuing time</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/ignoring-the-future/</link>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/ignoring-the-future/</guid>
      <description>Let’s suppose that all hours are equivalently valuable, and that you can easily earn more money by working more hours. There is still one more problem with valuing your time at your current average wage: not appropriately accounting for future benefits and costs.
Consider the following model of career progression:
In year \(0\), you are paid \($X\) (in nominal terms). In year \(1\), you are paid \($(X + W)\), or \($(X + W) \times R^{-1}\) in real terms.</description>

      <title>2 Mistakes When Valuing Time</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/mistakes-valuing-time/</link>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/mistakes-valuing-time/</guid>
      <description>People who make somewhat explicit time-money trade-offs often use something like their average wage as a proxy for the &amp;ldquo;value of time&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the price at which they are indifferent between spending money to save an hour and spending an hour to save money.
This is a reasonable start, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s mistaken, for at least 2 important reasons:
The value of a purchased hour depends on more than just wage level.</description>

      <description>I think that valuing time at your average wage is mistaken, for at least 3 reasons:
The value of a purchased hour depends on more than just wage level. [&amp;hellip;] In most instances, the more leisure time you have, the less you value an additional hour of it. [&amp;hellip;] Separate from how much work and leisure time you have when deciding to buy an hour, particular hours have characteristics &amp;ndash; energy level, time of day, location, etc.</description>

      <description>von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.
Edward Teller
Seeing through clouds Masha Gessen once wrote a series of articles for Slate grappling with her BRCA mutation. In the third article, she meets with my old boss David Laibson, hoping that he might be able to help think through the problem of whether to get an Oophorectomy, a Mastectomy, both, or neither.</description>

      <description>Friend that complements existing hobbies. Karaoke-loving weightlifter. Soccer player who is into intense thinking retreats. Acoustic- or bass-guitar-playing event planner. Friend that expands my horizons. Poetry-writing mechanical engineer. Yoga-practicing interior designer. History-obsessed cook. Fancy-bar-tending cheese-taster. Friend that has extreme and almost-aspirational character traits. Earnestness and virtuosity, pointed in a very different direction to that which I am used to. Gregariousness, intentionally directed. Extremely into self-improvement, or extremely anti-self-improvement Unabashed boldness.</description>

      <title>The cost of an O-1 visa</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/cost-of-o1/</link>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/cost-of-o1/</guid>
      <description>Not legal advice.
I estimate that the O-1 visa process:
Cost me around $37k in resources and time working towards the visa (&amp;ldquo;accounting terms&amp;rdquo;), or $77k in resources, time working towards the visa, and time not working as a result of waiting for the visa (&amp;ldquo;economic terms&amp;rdquo;). Would have taken ~8 months excluding unrelated delays. Links to code for these estimates here and here.
The main cost estimate &amp;ndash; accounting cost &amp;ndash; consists of my time (~$12k), my PA&amp;rsquo;s time (~$7k), lawyer fees ($11k), administrative costs ($3k), and necessary organization expenses (~$4k).</description>

      <description>My friend Arden and I were curious about hosting a sensory deprivation (or heightening) event. We began brainstorming:
blindfolded hide-and-seek; but with a bell, or squeaky chickens (better if they can be quiet). in multiple bedrooms? with multiple seekers? mix ingredients together in one team, have second team blind taste it	play with general idea of one team makes a thing, other has to identify. maybe do it telephone style? sensory deprivation relay: diff team members have diff senses deprived muffled speed-dating karaoke but only the singer is muffled (maybe humiliation shared between 2 people, hard to stay in sync) blindfolded dancing blind jenga silent telephone of one kind of another event brainstorming cool event ideas Eventually, we settled on running a blindfolded dinner, giant jenga, and hide-and-seek event: a &amp;ldquo;masked mixer.</description>

      <description>Title in homage to Linch.
In the second half of 2022, I was a Manifund regrantor. I ended up funding:
Holly Elmore to “[organize] for a frontier AI moratorium.” ($2.5k.) Jordan Schneider/ChinaTalk to produce “deep coverage of China and AI.” ($17.55k.) Robert Long to conduct “empirical research into AI consciousness and moral patienthood.” ($7.2k.) Greg Sadler/GAP organizational expenses. ($10k.) Nuño Sempere to “make ALERT happen.” ($8k.) Zhonghao He to “[map] neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>Diet is endogenous to exercise</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/exercise-vs-diet/</link>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/exercise-vs-diet/</guid>
      <description>There is a near-consensus that diet is more important than exercise, at least for aesthetics.
I think this idea suffers from a similar problem as that suffered by &amp;lsquo;calories in calories out&amp;rsquo;: although it might be true in some idealized sense, &amp;ldquo;calories out are endogenous to what is eaten&amp;rdquo;.
Here, diet-in-reality is largely determined by &amp;rsquo;the kind of person you believe yourself to be.&amp;rsquo; Exercising more makes it easier to see yourself as the kind of person who takes diet seriously, and therefore improves diet.</description>

      <description>The 4th of the famous 36 questions for falling in love is: &amp;ldquo;What would constitute a &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo; day for you?&amp;rdquo; On September 10th, 2023, I attempted to live out my answer.
Invitation The message to friends read, with minor edits:
Please only attend the parts of the day that speak to you, and RSVP if you will join any part of the day! I am expecting some activities to be popular, some activities to involve only me, and for ~no-one to attend everything!</description>

      <description>Scope-sensitivity is one of my favorite ideas.
In this post, I will apply the concept to personal finance. The idea to do this is entirely due to my friend Arden. I&amp;rsquo;m just writing it down.
I&amp;rsquo;ll survey some options, then discuss what I take from them.
Options Transportation Food Consumer goods Finance Work [ANALYSIS]
best allocation for me
best allocation as function of cost of time
[TAKEAWAYS]

wait, work seems like odd one out.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve gotten past novitiate weightlifting aches, enduring 4+ sessions weekly. How should you now split exercises across days?
My answer is: use the posterior-anterior split. One day for the muscles used in a deadlift (back, hamstrings, glutes) plus biceps, one day for more-or-less everything else (chest, front- and side-delts, triceps, quads, hip flexors).
Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
The goal We want to train muscle groups as intensively as possible, as frequently as possible, whilst not training the same muscle group within fewer than 48 hours.</description>

      <description>This list is a work-in-progress. In descending order of preference:
Passion Fruit - agua de maracuya This &amp;ldquo;Passion Fruit&amp;rdquo; is a smoothie place in La Condesa (CDMX) that sells, among other treats, passion fruit juice by the bucket. My favorite passion fruit product of all time! I love that it isn&amp;rsquo;t too sweetened, and that the seeds have separated from the juice. The only problem is the large blocks of ice that they put in the buckets.</description>

      <description>Epistemic status: not sure how reliable my intuition is, but I do have more experience with these programs than most.
TL;DR Making sure &amp;gt;30 participants have regular opportunities to spontaneously gather, active programming, basic food and medical amenities, and common knowledge about visit dates hugely increases the benefit of residential fellowship programs.
For transparency, I should note a stronger, less confident belief of mine that I will not defend here. My instinct is that all of the above factors are not merely beneficial but necessary in order for these programs to be worth their cost (assuming that their goals are indeed as I describe below).</description>

      <description>Suppose you agree with me that discussion of the &amp;ldquo;value of time&amp;rdquo; is ridden with conceptual confusion.
you seek a better way see conceptual confusion 1 notice that even if you can state how much better an hour of your time will be with friends vs alone, at cafe vs office, etc., you don&amp;rsquo;t know which hour this is occurring during toby has framework for this! Toby Ord presents a simple mathematical framework for understanding how reducing existential risk compares with other ways of influencing the longterm future.</description>
